For a robotic assembly, it is the part that requires the most advanced techniques, but it could be facilitated with a well engineered process. Different are discussed for the assembly of mirrors and then magnetic joints are presented.\nThis design ease the assembly for the robot. First, the grasping is made using magnetization so no need for special grasping. There is no lost surface and the bars are lighter which is a very important consideration for an on-­orbit assembly where the payload is very costly. Then because of the symmetry of the bars, the assembly needs to care only about the orientation of the element on the z axis. Finally, this design can easily be printed in space same as the ”Trusselator” which considerably reduces the payload for big structures assembly.\nAutonomous path planning The number of steps is the number of modifications of the joint angle. The DQL showed good results. With this Policy, the robot could find the optimal path to the target with the minimum number of 3 steps. Finally, that technique was kept to make the Pick and Place environment where the robot had to catch a ball with a magnetized end-effector and place it in another desired position. In the end, the robot did it with an average of 5 steps.\n","date":1625529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625529600,"objectID":"8567874ca6b4810035227cb46a9dc722","permalink":"https://jorandg.github.io/publication/master-thesis/","publishdate":"2021-07-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/master-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"The needs for path planning with super-human capabilities has been applied for truss assembly.","tags":[],"title":"Master Thesis on Path Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jorand Gallou"],"categories":null,"content":"Installation In order to manipulate the MK1 we used an arduino uno and a joystick as you can see on the following picture:\nThe servos are plugged on the PWN pins 5, 6, 9.

As a slave, it responds to a serial command of speed intensity on both translation and rotation possible on the ground. The raspberry is the master and controls all the actuators.\nMechanical Design The robot manufacturing tries to take advandage of 3D printing. This would allow for a greater sharing of the project.\nAs the project aims to be open source, we try to make the robot fully 3D printable. Here can be found the differnet parts.\nThe Meccanum wheels are the key part of the robot, and enable it to have 3 degrees of liberty on the ground.\nElementary Programming Our goal to introduce algorithm theory from the youngest age. We provide an easy way to learn how to structure computer code and execute it.\nOur system has the particularity to allow children to code without a computer. With a pencil and a sheet of paper, you can start to code the robot\u0026rsquo;s movements. The idea is to open the doors of programming as soon as possible and to as many people as possible. Verification the programming of the robot path is done with the application.
