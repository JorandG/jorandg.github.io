It was then possible to use it for supervised learning.\nThe proposed dataset generator gave a way to feed the neural networks. It has now the ability to estimate accurately its position with a wide range of vision. Thanks to an appropriate landing pad shape, even seeing only part of the landing area permits the drone to descend.\nGuidance and Control For visual servoing, a multi-scale control is proposed where control sensitivity depends on drone altitude. The use of the neural network in a simulated environment multiplied by three the processing rate, the control is thus closer to real time.\nMechanical Landing Gear For fast landing situations, the vertical speed is higher than standard descent. The research proposes a landing gears that absorbs more than ten times the kinetic energy of standard landing legs.

In addition to improve delivery, there have been many developments within space research aiming to reduce global cost. Reusable rockets are regarded as the future of space travel, however, numerous accidents have been observed during landing, making these rockets an unreliable resource for experimentation. This new benchmark system is a reliable platform. It mainly embeds drone and model making components on an electric thrust vectored rocket architecture.\nUnder its state conditions and using Newton\u0026rsquo;s laws, the equations of motion approximate an inverted pendulum.\nIt has then been simulated on MATLAB. It proves that a PID control loop allows the system to accurately takeoff, hover and land.\nAs a proof of concept, a real prototype is under development. It is now time to optimize flight-time and implement transition between hovering and standard flight.\n","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"561a8aea7128c44dcf5f8636905641ec","permalink":"https://jumellet.github.io/publication/e-rocket/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/e-rocket/","section":"publication","summary":"Fast autonomous flying and reausable rocket platform are now possible thanks to the eRocket.

As a slave, it responds to a serial command of speed intensity on both translation and rotation possible on the ground. The raspberry is the master and controls all the actuators.\nMechanical Design The robot manufacturing tries to take advandage of 3D printing. This would allow for a greater sharing of the project.\nAs the project aims to be open source, we try to make the robot fully 3D printable. Here can be found the differnet parts.\nThe Meccanum wheels are the key part of the robot, and enable it to have 3 degrees of liberty on the ground.\nElementary Programming Our goal to introduce algorithm theory from the youngest age. We provide an easy way to learn how to structure computer code and execute it.\nOur system has the particularity to allow children to code without a computer. With a pencil and a sheet of paper, you can start to code the robot\u0026rsquo;s movements. The idea is to open the doors of programming as soon as possible and to as many people as possible.
